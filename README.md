# NON OFFICIAL PRACTICE FOLDER

A month ago, I have been swimming in the *42 C piscine*. I failed, although in my vocabulary there is no such thing as *failure* to describe those moments that give you experience and tell you what to do next.

Anyway, I found that doing those exercises was a good way to practice back to basis. Also, as I am doing now, having practice with github, organizing my folders, formatting my readme, creating branches, writting in English... Lot of things that will be useful before being involved in a project with other people.

Otherwise, those lines of code won't respect the Norminette format and don't contain headers. I do not have access to them anymore. I just solve them from time to time during some breaks when I have too few time to do large tasks. Also, I do not include the pdfs that I took from other githubs to avoid misunderstanding with people who eventually end there and didn't read this readme.

Thanks all for your support!
